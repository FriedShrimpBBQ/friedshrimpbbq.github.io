With AI being all the rage today, could we conceivably quickly put together a short story or even a [novella in a month](https://nanowrimo.org/) using AI to assist us in story writing?

Although these tools have been around for a while, I never felt "compelled" to try and tell a story until I came across [Mythic Game Master Emulator](https://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic-gme.html). Having a system to generate events, randomness, character traits with the ability to tell a story and use your imagination seems like the perfect way to guide an AI to tell a story in a way which (hopefully) is compelling.

Of course this isn't the _only_ way to tell a story. There are many other frameworks and structures - such as how many stories encapsulate a [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) - though this way is the first time I've encountered a way to write or be guided on a story without knowing where it may go or what the outcome is. Of course, being a [Game Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster) means it will be suited to the world of fantasy, action and adventure (you probably won't be writing a romance, drama) it probably suites me well, just to _see_ where it goes.

At the very worse, it will teach me the limitations of these text generating tools and understand better how to leverage these tools going forward.
