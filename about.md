_What am I currently working on?_

I'm interested in WASM and the hope that it brings. Currently I'm investing some time working in the Go ecosystem (namely [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/), and understanding how to bring tiny machine learning models to that kind of ecosystem via hand-coding models and federated learning setups. 

_What do I actually do?_

I currently work as an engineer, having managed and scaled up production-ready backend systems that typically handle tens of thousands of requests per minute.
