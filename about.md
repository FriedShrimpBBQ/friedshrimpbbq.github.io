This is it. Is it possible to do development work on a ~14 year old laptop? Let's take a stab. 

My setup - as of Jan 2023:
- Hardware: Sony Vaio SR series (2008)
- OS: Windows 10
- IDE: [micro editor](https://micro-editor.github.io/)
* Default theme: [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) for almost everything!
* Note taking: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

Future setup:
- OS: [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/)
