In my quest to write a game master emulator, I have unfortunatley strugged with GUI interfaces and deferred to what I'm comfortable with. To ensure I made progress, I quickly prototyped (and almost solved) the problem using Mithril.js, and themed with Openmoji and Bulma. The results is actually okay, though the table generation isn't quite correct.

Since this is done, is there still a need to do it in Golang? I think so! Partly to learn Go, as I was struggling a bit to figure out the correct data structures specific to Go, and also to understand how we can distribute applications in a consistent manner to both CLI and Web experiences would be an amazing thought experiment. 

I think Go with WASM support for the web is an extremely useful gateway to bridge CLI tools with Web interfaces. 

## On Openmoji

Openmoji, despite its whimsical and sometimes inconsistent theming, was amazing to use, compared with fontawesome. Fontawesome looks great when you need polish, but the color and rather _loose_ nature of Openmoji is perfect for this project. Infact for this project, I ended up using `openmoji-awesome` which replicates the interfaces provided by fontawesome, which helped with transitioning. 

Despite saying I'll use a GUI framework for Go, I might stick with using Go WASM with Mithril and Bulma in future projects. Using Go as a "backend" and Mithril as front-end separation gives me a lot of freedom and more importantly speed to work through ideas and deploy quickly.
